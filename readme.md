<h1> My Grocery List program </h1>

This is my first little program in Ruby so it's pretty basic - it just tracks a grocery list. 

<h2> Main features </h2>

<h4> Add and Remove items from list </h4> 

You can choose to add or remove items from the list. If you remove items it gets put in the a bought items list. If you try to remove an item that wasn't added originally, there's an option to add directly to bought items. 

<h4> Save and Open a list </h4>

You can save the list as a txt file and open lists you've already saved to edit them later. 

<h4> To dos: </h4>

- Bulk item add/removes 
- Take in a username and welcome back like Brett's fork: https://github.com/brettsanders/grocery_list/blob/master/json/grocery_list_with_json_persistence.rb
